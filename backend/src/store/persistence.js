/**
 * @file persistence.js
 * @description Durable backing for the in-memory store.
 *
 * The services all work against `store` synchronously (`store.payments.find(...)`,
 * `payment.status = 'PAID'`). Rewriting every call site to async Mongoose would be a
 * large, risky change for a dataset of a few hundred documents, so instead the whole
 * working set is loaded into memory at boot and written back to MongoDB whenever it
 * changes. Reads stay instant; the database is the durable copy that survives a restart.
 *
 * Writes are flushed at request boundaries (see server.ts), on a periodic safety timer,
 * and on shutdown, so the worst case loss is an in-flight request rather than everything.
 *
 * Only documents that changed since they were last read or written are sent. Rewriting
 * the whole set on every request sent ~30 MB to Atlas per save (ID cards and payment
 * screenshots live inline in some documents) and used up the host's bandwidth.
